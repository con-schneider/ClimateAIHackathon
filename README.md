# ClimateAIHackathon
Notebooks created during the Oxford Foundry Climate AI Impact Weekend. The data used to generate the models can either be downloaded using the fire_data_files.ipynb via the IBM PAIRS API or downloaded at this google drive folder: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qbtC4GFUCNmq6XjNJVT3Soa1cebE-mQf?usp=sharing)

The fire_model.ipynb notebook details the proof-of-principle model generated from the NDVI and fire data.
